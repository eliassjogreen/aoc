# Advent of ~~Chaos~~ Code - 2023

> [!CAUTION]
> Featuring advanced parallel solutions in a
> [language](https://futhark-lang.org) I don't know

2023 I tried to write my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions in
[Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org), a language I don't know in a style I don't
know, on GPUs, which I don't know. I didn't get very far, which I am blaming on
string manipulation and transformation being very hard in Futhark, because it
has no helpers or std library for it and mainly it being targeted for doing
parallelizeable computation and transformation.
